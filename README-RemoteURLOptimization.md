# Remote URL Transcription Optimization

## Overview
This feature enhancement allows the transcription service to directly process remote audio files via URL without having to first download them to the server. For compatible formats (mp3, m4a, wav), the system will send the URL directly to the Deepgram API, resulting in faster processing and reduced server load.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Direct URL Support
The `callWhisper` function in `lib/service.js` now checks if the input data includes a `remote_url` property. If present, it extracts the file extension and determines if the format is compatible for direct processing.

For compatible files:
- The URL is sent directly to Deepgram's API via the `transcribeUrl` function
- Results are stored in the database using the provided `guid` for future reference
- No local file download is required

### 2. Compatible Formats
Currently, the following formats are supported for direct URL processing:
- `.mp3` (MP3 audio)
- `.m4a` (AAC audio)
- `.wav` (WAV audio)

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
If direct URL transcription fails for any reason, the system automatically falls back to the original method of downloading the file and processing it locally.

### 4. Example Usage
When submitting a job with a remote URL:

```javascript
// Example data format
const data = {
  guid: "unique-identifier-123",
  remote_url: "https://example.com/audio/recording.mp3",
  filePath: "/path/to/local/file.mp3" // Still required but not used in direct URL mode
};

// Submit to service
submitService("WHSPR", data);
```

## Testing
You can test this feature using the included test script `test_remote_optimization.js`:

```
node test_remote_optimization.js
```

This script directly calls the `transcribeUrl` function with a test MP3 file URL.

## Benefits
- Reduced bandwidth usage - files aren't downloaded to the server
- Faster processing - eliminates download time
- Reduced storage requirements - no temporary file storage needed
- Simplified workflow for remote audio sources

## Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid URL formats are detected and rejected
- Transcription failures trigger a fallback to local processing
- Results are properly cached for future requests using the same guid
